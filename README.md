# minimalisation-of-levis-functions
Minimalisation of Levi's function using genetic algorithm
* Algorithm is written in python programming language.
* If you want to run the project, you need to install Python 3. To run it use the command: python main.py
* All the configuration parameters are in the file config.py.
  •	pop_size – population size
  •	repetitions – number of experiment repetitions
  •	max_iter – maximum number of generations for one population
  •	zaokruzivanje – number of decimal point numbers for solution
  •	opseg [float, float] - scope of possible chromosome values
  •	mut_rate – probability for the bit to be mutated
  •	levijeva_funkcija – fitness function and also the function we are trying to minimize
